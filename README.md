# OFDM Simulation in MATLAB

## Overview
This project is a basic MATLAB simulation of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. It demonstrates:
- QAM modulation and demodulation.
- Cyclic prefix handling.
- BER analysis in an AWGN channel.

⚠️ **Note**: This is a work-in-progress prototype and might not be fully optimized or functional for all scenarios.

## How to Use
1. Open `ofdm_sim.mlx` in MATLAB.
2. Configure any parameters (e.g., FFT size, modulation order) in the script.
3. Run the script and view the BER results.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Add support for multipath fading channels.
- Implement channel estimation and equalization.
- Optimize noise scaling to match theoretical SNR accurately.
